  <h2>A little about me...</h2>
  <p>I am forty-ish, a felon and excited about this new experience. I have two daughters, one step-son and one grandson. I was an office/showroom manager for almost ten years, was diagnosed with MS and introduced to pain clinics. It has been quite the roller-coaster ride but the entire experience has made me who I am today. And I not only feel better than I can ever remember but also through my incarceration I learned to like myself.</p>
